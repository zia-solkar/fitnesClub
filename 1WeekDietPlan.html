						<p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><b>-</b> The 3-day military diet is actually split into 2 phases over a 7-day period. For the first 3 days, you must follow a set low-calorie meal plan for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There are no snacks between meals.
	        			Total calorie intake during this phase is roughly 1,100–1,400 calories per day.<br><br>

						<b>-</b> This is much lower than the average adult’s intake, but you can check your own calorie requirements using this calculator. For the remaining 4 days of the week, you are encouraged to eat healthy and continue to keep your calorie intake low. Proponents of the diet claim that you can repeat the diet several times until you reach your goal weight. <br><br> 
						
						<b>-</b> The secret to maintaining an ideal weight is to not skip meals and timing your meals. Consuming decent morsels of protein-rich food every two hours ensures you are satiated and do not delay eating your next meal or overeat a big meal (like a dinner or lunch).</p>
